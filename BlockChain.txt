1. Understanding International Standards
ISO/TC 307: The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established this technical committee to develop standards for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.
ISO 22739: Vocabulary for blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.
ISO 30701: Guidelines for governance.
ISO/TR 23244: Privacy and personally identifiable information (PII) protection in blockchain.
ISO/TR 23576: Security management of digital asset custodians.
Other frameworks like NIST guidelines (National Institute of Standards and Technology) can also provide insights into security considerations.


2. Key Areas of Blockchain Security
Cryptography Standards:
Secure cryptographic algorithms like AES, SHA-256, or elliptic curve cryptography.
Consensus Mechanisms:
Security vulnerabilities in Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and others.
Smart Contract Security:
Verification, testing, and audit standards for smart contracts.
Identity and Access Management:
Standards for authentication, authorization, and identity management in blockchain.
Data Privacy:
Implementing GDPR-compliant privacy-preserving techniques in blockchain.
Interoperability:
Standards ensuring secure interaction between different blockchain platforms.


3. Implementation Feasibility
Analysis of Existing Implementations:
Study blockchain networks (Ethereum, Hyperledger, etc.) to analyze their compliance with international standards.
Development of Security Protocols:
Implement protocols aligned with ISO and NIST guidelines.
Testing and Auditing:
Use automated tools for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Pilot Projects:
Develop a pilot blockchain application and test its security against international standards.

1. Security Analysis and Compliance
ISO/TC 307 Standards:
(I)  ISO 22739:  (a) Terminology and Process Validation

Asset: Anything that has value to a stakeholder. 

Block: Structured data comprising a block header and block data. 

Blockchain: Distributed ledger with confirmed blocks organized in an append-only, sequential chain using hash links. 

Consensus: Agreement among DLT nodes that a transaction is validated and the distributed ledger contains a consistent set and ordering of records of validated transactions. 

Cryptoasset: Digital asset implemented using cryptographic techniques. 

Cryptocurrency: Cryptoasset designed to work as a medium of payment or value exchange. 

Decentralized Application (Dapp): Application that runs on a decentralized system. 

Distributed Ledger: Ledger that is shared across a set of DLT nodes and synchronized between the nodes using a consensus mechanism. 

DLT Node: Device or process that participates in a network and stores a complete or partial replica of the ledger records. 

Smart Contract: Program stored and executed across a DLT system that encapsulates contractual clauses under which parties agree to interact. 

Transaction: Record of an event that is stored in a distributed ledger. 

Validator: DLT node that is responsible for validating transactions and blocks in a DLT system
